// configuration) into a SNO cluster with a desired configuration. During an
// IBU, this information is taken from the cluster that is being upgraded (the
// original SNO's LCA writes a file to the seed stateroot to communicate this
// information). During an IBI, this information is placed in the configuration
// ISO created by the image-based-install-operator.

// WARNING: Changes to this struct and its sub-structs should not be made
// lightly, as it is also used by the image-based-install-operator. Any changes

// or be backwards compatible. If you've made a breaking change, you will need
// to increment the SeedReconfigVersion constant to avoid silent breakage and
// allow for backwards compatibility code.

	// new cluster, in case one had to be pre-generated for some reason.
	ClusterID string `json:"cluster_id,omitempty"`

	// The desired infra ID for the cluster. No install-config.yaml equivalent,
	// as it is randomly generated from the cluster name + some random chars.
	// Similarly to cluster-ID, this can either be empty, in which case a new
	// infra-ID will be generated by LCA, or it can be set to the infra ID of
	// the new cluster, in case one had to be pre-generated for some reason.

	// The seed image must have an existing kubeadmin password secret, this is
	// because the secret is rejected by OCP if its creation timestamp differs
	// from the kube-system namespace creation timestamp by more than 1 hour.
	// During IBU, this is taken from the cluster that is being upgraded.
	// During IBI, this is generated in advance so it can be displayed to the
