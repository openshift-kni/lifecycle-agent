// SeedClusterInfo is a struct that contains information about the seed cluster
// that was used to create the seed image. It is meant to be serialized to a
// file on the seed image. It has multiple purposes, see the documentation of
// each field for more information.
//
// Changes to this struct should not be made lightly, as it will break
// backwards compatibilitiy with existing seed images. If you've made a
// breaking change, you will need to increment the [SeedFormatVersion] constant
// to avoid silently breakage and allow for backwards compatibility code.

	// image. During an IBU, lifecycle-agent will compare the user's desired
	// version with the seed cluster's version to ensure the image the user is
	// using is actually using the version they expect. During an IBI, this
	// parameter is ignored.
	SeedClusterOCPVersion string `json:"seed_cluster_ocp_version,omitempty"`

	// The base domain of the seed cluster that was used to create this seed
	// image. This in combination with the cluster name is used to construct
	// the cluster's full domain name. That domain name is required when we ask
	// recert to replace the domain in certificates, as recert needs both the
	// original domain (the seed's) and the new domain to perform the replace.
